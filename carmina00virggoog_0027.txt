⁸ that either by treating his subject too literally, he should make it
Ι dryand repulsive; or that he should so overlay it with ornament,
ts to render his instructions useless aud unintelligible, or that
Ι he should, by undue elevation of what is apparently mean and

the old gardener, probably visited by him on the journey to Bruu-
Ι dusium with Horace and Maecenas, which he gives with so
Ι much enjoyment, aud such exquisitely minute touches, subordi-
nate, however, all the while to his main purpose os reaching
how bees may be most profitably rearsdl Belonging also to the
¹ same illustrative faculty is his habit of seizing hold os an incident
Ι common enough in rural lise, and giving it activity and person-
Ι ality, ae in bis instructions regarding the viper, Cape sucu manre,
mperohnapastor. But his poetica} power is principallydisplayed
in those episodes, by which he has enriched the Georgius with
Ι some os the most finished specimens os poetry that exist in any
language. Donatus tells us that Virgil, while writing the Georg·
ies, was in the habit os dictating to bis amanuensis in tha moru-
ing severel lines, and that his sole employrncnt during the day
was to reduce their number, and bring the selected t‘ew to the
proper state os polish; and adds, that he compared himself net
uuaptly to a bear licking her cubs into shepe. Whether this be
Ι true or not,¹ the result os his labours undoubtedly is, that in the
Georgica we have one os the most finished productione es which
human language seems susceptible.

We cannot say the same os the third, tlre lougest and most
