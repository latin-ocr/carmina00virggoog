in the seventh summer alter the destruction of Troy, with tho
lauding oi Aeneas on the coast os Carthago, and his hospitable
reception by Dido} ln the two following boolrs Aeneas narratas
to Dido his wanderings, from the downtall of Troy up till that
time. The fourth contains the loves os Aeneas and Dido, the
departure os the former by the command os the gods, and the
despair and voluntary death ol' the latter. In the llilh, Aeneas
visits Sicily3 and in the sixth arrives in Italy, where, at Cumae,
he desceuds to the shades, and has an interview with his father
Anchises The remaining books are occupied with his struggles
to obtain a settlemsnt in Italy, the laud destined to his rece-the
offers os Latinus, king os the Latine, who agrees to marry to him
his daughter, and give him a kingdom-the opposition of the
Rutulian king, Turnus, to whom Lavinia had been betrothed-
the mustering of allies ou both sides-the repeated deleats οι
the Rutulians, in spite os the gallant dseds os Turnus-his final
overthrow and death, and the triumph os Aeneas.

Objections have been made to the Aeneid‚ altogether indepen-
dently of its being an unfinished worlr. These resolve them·
selvas into Virgil’s wantos originality, his alleged poverty of
invention, the sameness of his characters, and, above all, the fatal
objection that his hero is totally devoid of interest To some ol'
these no satisfactory answer can be given. lt was an unfortu-
nate thing tbat he chose to form himself so much on the model
of Homer, and to trust too little ιο his own original powers. Tast
he has done so cannot be denisd. And il the question were,
whether the Aeneid is to be read solely sor its own underived
excellenciesl we should have to except a very large portion.
But the question assumes a very different aspect when we with
toexamine not the powers os the poet, but the charms of the poem.
In this view we areat liberty to admire the now sorm in which
Virgil osten reproduces the thoughts of his master. The alleged
poverty of invention, in incidente at least, is not so apparent.
The rapid changes of soenery and event, especially in the early
books, are a convinoing proos that his powers were not essentially
deficient in this respect Nor can the charge os samcness of cha·
raoter be admitted. No doubt there is too much os the sortesque
Gyan, fortemque Charcham. But there must be walliing gentle·
