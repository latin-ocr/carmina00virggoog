INTRODUG'HCN· Ω

11 was while returning from one of these excursione that tho
emperor met Virgil, on what was destined 10 be the poet‘s last
iourney. Ha bad contemplated, it is said, a tour through Graece
and Asia, to furnish him with more copious materiale, and 111010
11101110 observation, so that the Aeneid, now blocked 011, but
all nnpolished, might receive the last touches of his master hand.
Augustus was returning from Samos, where he had passed the
two preceding wintere, and met Virgil in Athens. The latter,
either feeling already the incipient weakness of disease, or
willing to gratify his great friend, abandoned his first intention,
and agreed 10 return with him. At Megara, his fatal illness de·
veloped itself, and increased during the voyage 10 Italy. A few
days aster his arrival at Brundusium, he died,on the aad of
September, a. 0. 19, within twenty-three days 01 completiug 1110
fifty-first year, probably the same year that witnessed the death
of the poet Tibullus.

According to Donatus, he had spent the later years 01 his life
partly in Sicily, but chiefly in Campania. The delightful climate
and scenery 01 Naples being associated with his greatest enjoy-
ments, he directed that he should be buried there. Accordingly,
Augustus ordered his bones to be transferred thither, and a tomb
was erected over them near the uia Puteolano on Mount Posilipo,
1000 than two miles from N aples. A tornb (see teil-piace)‚.almcst
universally believed to ba that 01 Virgil, is still pointed out, in
a situation corresponding 10 that mentioned by 1101110110,ι aad
