of Anchises is not that of Evander or Latinus, nor the youth of
Euryalus that of Ascanius, nor the bravery of Mezentius that of
Turnus, nor the rage of Amata that of Didot The deities also
preserve their characteristics; and Jupiter

from that of Neptune, as the lineamenta and state of Venus are
different from those of J uno. The last objection--that founded
on the character of Aeneas-seems the most serious and irreme·
diablo of all, as it runs through the whole work, aud affecte its
power ιο please, apert from the question of originality. It has
been alleged that Virgil has here sailed, because his aim wasto
represent Augustus iu Aeneas, and that the character of the
former was incompatible with heroic dignity. But, critically
considered, though this were the case, it would only prove that
he was destitute either of elrill in selection, or of that power of
ereating a character which constitutes the true poet. There is
no question that ha did intend to cornpliment Angustus. He had
personally experienced the fearful woes ιο which his country
had been subjected by the civil ware. He seems early ιο have
abandoned the party of Antony, to which his own retired and medi·
tative habits had probably never induced him to form an attach-
ment stronger than that which arose from the ties of personal
affection to some of its leading men. Thenceforth he flung him·
self entirely ou the side of· Maecenas and Augustus, as of men
who alone could heal the bleeding wounds of the country which
he so ardently loved. He fondiy hoped that Rome would rival
Graece in arts, as she had before conquered hetin arms3 and
he strove todo his best ιο accomplish this end. And in all this
Augustus was his hope, aa it was that of Horace and other reflective
und leading rninds of that age. But it seems an over-refinement
ιο suppose that in the Aeneid the characters are representatione
of those men that thronged the court of Augustus, or took place
in the events that affected his history, and that the battles and
struggles are intended to ehadow forth the conflicts that raised
Augustus to the empire. Virgil seems to have had before him
iu Aeneas, not a representation of Augustus, but a distinct con·
ception of a character noble in itself, though, unfortunately for
his main design, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to invest it
with interest when success is to accompany it. His design was,
having before him the destinies of the mightiest empire that the
world had ever seen, to give its founder a character befitting.

He was to be a man of warm affectione, sager to see his storm-
buffetted friends and followers at last reposing in peace, but with
implicit reliunce on the will of Heaven, and determined to forego
all consideratione, not for himself, but for that posterity whose
destinies depended on his obedience ιο the behests of the gods.
Hence the pius Aeneas sacrifices his own feelings at all timos ιο
