of night, ever been more happily describedi And how finsly dt
these nrild and tendet images contram with the powersul repre·
sentations of the guthering aud hursting tempest in the first hook
of the Georgica, and with tha descriptione in the Aeneid cf du
navigation and landing at the Strophades, the crashing fall uf the
rmk, and of Aetna with its flames l¹ ln truth, howefer, individual
localities are often portrayed, and that to the life, by Virgil, at
any one glaucing at the scene described in the first Eclogue will
atonce admit. ln ona respect the Eclogues have an original
merit, which it becomes us to notice. Without losing sight of
that aoitness which is a leading characteristic of the true Idyl, he
gives to some of his themes¹ a simple grandeur, which is so far
from being incompatihle with rural images, that the latter twiua
round the stately stem in most graceful and hefitting ornament.
The next work is the Gaoasrcs. lt belongs ιο that difficolt
classes poerns called Didactic, whose objectis ιο convey instruo·
tion pleasingly and invitingly through the medium of poetry.
The purpose for which it was written has been already meu·
tioned-the revival of agriculture in Italy, devastated by the
long and crnel civil wars. Itis dedicated ιο Maecenas, the
patron and friend of Virgil. Itis dirided into four books, each of
which treats of a different subject The first treats of the culti·
ration of the soil, and the operations of agriculture connected
with sowing, and the different occupatione that are proper for the
different seasous. The second regards the cultivation of trees,
especially of the vine. The third treats of the various animala
that are more immediately useful in agriculture-horsea, oren,
sheep, goats, and dags. The fourth is occupied with the care of
bees. Itis impossible to praise too highly the mode in which
Virgil has executed this work3 and though the subject had before
exercised thapsus both of Greek and Roman writers, and out
poet had especially before him the Opera et Dies of Hesiod, there
’ is little of the close imitation thetis to be found occasionally iu
the Eclogues. Italy was his field, and he confines himself to
this; his aim being, in tmth, ιο benefit his countrymen. Tahing
into view the popularity of Virgil, we are entitled ιο presumo
that his verses, passing from mouth to mouth, contributed mate
terially to effect the object which he had in view. And we lrnow
that not only did the ancient writers on agriculture refer ιο him
as an unquestionable authority, but we are told in modern Italy
, his maxims are found ιο be as sound as ever. Martyn-no mean
authority-even says: ‘Though the soil and chate of Itaiy are
different from those of England, yet it has been found by expe·
tierice that most of his rules may be put in practice even here

¹ See especially the fourth Eclogue.
