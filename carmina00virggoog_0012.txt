omens which at his birth predictsd the future greatness ot* tha
wonderful infant, that we are induced to doubt the whole. This
much seems certain, that his mother's name was Maia, and that
his parents, though obscure, were possessed of some property,
aud were neither unable nor unwilling to impert ιο their son a
liberal education. This, according ιο the traditione regardinghim,
preserved by Donatus,¹ was carried on at Cremona, Mediolanum
(Milan), and afterwards at Neapolis (Naples). lt has been
conjectured that Virgil received instructions from Catius, an
lnsubrian professores the Epicurean philosophy. But this rests
on no other foundation than what we learn from Cicero-that
Catius was alive about this time, and that Mediolanum, in which
it is possible that Virgil then lived, was an Insubrian town. We
have better authority for believing that at Naples he studied
Greek under Parthenius, a native oi Nicaea, in Bithynia, one of
whose prose worlrs has come down to us, and who, as a writer of
puetry‚¹ was a great favourite of the noble Romans of his time.
It seems certain that he enjoyed at Rome, ιο which he removed
from Naples, the instructions of Syron, an Epicurean philosopher,
much commended by Cicero.

If we may credit Donatus, Virgil assumed the toga cirili· at
Cremona, on his birthday, when he had completed his fifieenth
ycar; in the consulship again of Ponrpey and Crassus, ι. c. 55.
During the interval between his birth and this event, Pompey
and Caesar had both consolidated their power. The former had
conducted ιο a successful termination the Piratic and Mith-
ridatio wars3 and the latter had exhibited in Gaul his extraor-
dinary skill as a general, prompt, breve, and politic. During
this time also Catilina and Clodius had, the oue succumbed to,
end the other triumphed over, the eloquence of Cicero. lt was
in thie year lilrewiaa that Caesar first invaded Britain-totu
diuisor orde Britannos.⁸ “

We are compellcd ιο conjecture the incidente of our author's
life aster he had finished his early studies at Rome. It is
probable that his health (which we learn incidentally from
Horace, aa well as directlyfrom his biographer, to have been
infirm, in consequence of a feeble stomach and an asthmatic
tendency) prevented him from aiming at distinction by the
usual means by which obscure men of talant theu rose to
