eloquence. Nor does hie temperament seem to have fitted him
to struggle with the difficulties os that troubled time. We need
not wonder, then, to find him engaged in rural pursuits in the
neighbourhood of his birthplace, on the banks of the Mincius.

To this period is assigned the greater portion ol certain poema
which are by some attributed to Virgil, but which are not gene·
rally given along with his more notable works in an edition such
as this. The priucipal os these are Gulae, Οἰνία, Moratum, Oopa,
and Ootaltclo. The Galea narratas an adventure connected with
the death of agnat: the eins tells the love of Scylla, daughter
ot* Nisus, king os Megara, sor Minos, her treachery to her father,
and her change into the bird bearing the name Ciris: the More-
tum (said to be an imitation os a Greek poem on the same snb·
ject by his teacher Parthenius) is named from a kind os saled,
the concoction os which, along with other rustic in·door opera·
tione, preparatory sor going to out-door work, is the subject os tbe
poem. These are written in hexameter verse. The Copo (cotr-

which those who kept places ol public entertainment allured by·

ol short poems os various merite as well as matres. Of these the
Gulae, Ciris, and a portion os the catalecto, have no great impress

younger efforts.¹

“ Public events, meanwhile, were hastening to a crisis. The
civil war between Pompey and Caesar, with the events which
followed, are too well known, and have too little direct bearing
upon the fortunas of our author, to require more than mention
here. But it is absolutely necessary to notice more at length the
subsequent turn taken by publio affairs, as they exercised a pow-
ersul influence on his history.

Julius Caesar was assassinated on the 15th March rac. tt,
when Virgil was twenty-five, and when Octavius, the grandson
of the dictator's sister, adopted by him that very year, was nine·
teen years os age. Antony, who was consul sor the year, and
had inflamed the passions of the populace so strongly against
the 'conspiratum that they were immediately obliged to flea from
Rome, was brought from personal views into hostile collisiou
with Octavianus, who at first naturally looked to him sor assist-

His real calling was lyric oetry, for his small lyric poema-sor in-
stance that on the villa os gyron, and the one conrmencing ‘Si mihr
susceptum fuerit decurrere munus'—show that he would have been u
poet like Catullus if he had not been led away hy his desire to write
a grem Latin poem.’-Niebuhr’s History os Rome. vol. v. p. 158.
