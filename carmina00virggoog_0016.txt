sur his success at Perusia having placed all Italy iu the hands
of Octavianus, Pollio was superseded iu his command, and the
taslr of assigning the landa committed ιο Cornelius Gallus, also
distinguished as a poet and orator, and Varus, both of whom had
been follow-pupils of Virgil under Syron. Even their favour did
not protect our poet from the violence of the soldiery. The lands
about Cremona, which had, from favouring tha conspiratura, reu·
dered itself obnoxious ιο the veterane os Caesar, did not suffice,
and Mantua, though not in the same position, was, fremitu
proximity, exposed to the sama fate. Resides, Antonius Musa,
who was associated with Varus and Gallus, had private reasons
for pressing hard upon the Mantuam. in the consequent seizura
of their landa, the protection before given ιο the poet, aud which
he endeavoured to secure by celebrating Varus in his sixth
Eclogue, did not now avail him. He was obliged to flee before
the swerd of an augry soldier, and took shelter‚ it is said, with
his master Syron, where he wrote the ninth Eclogne, s. c. 40.
In the meantime Antouy, who had behaved himself disgrace·
sully in Asia and Egypt, was summoned by his wife, while on
his march in an expedition against the Parthians, ιο support his
declining cause in Italy. He met her in Greece, where she died,
bnt he sailed to Italy, where he found Octavianus at Brundusium
ready to oppose him· On the other hand, Antony had been
joined by a strong reinforcement, as Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus,
who commanded the constitutional fleet, was induced by Pollio
to corne over ιο his side. In these circumstances neither party
was averse to peace, which was conducted under the mediatiou
of Maecenas 011 the side of Octavianus, Pollio on that of Autony,
and Cocceius, a common friend of both—an event which is com·
memorated in the fourth Eclogue. It was at this time that An-
tony married Octavia, the sister of Octavianus. Virgil now found
easy access to Octavianus, and either formed or confirmed his
friendsbip with Maecenas. His lands were, in consequence,
restored to him, and it we may credit Servius, his influence was
strong enough ιο obtain a partial redress for the Mantuans.¹

¹We have thought it right, in such a work as this, ιο follow the
account of the various steps by which the oet was ultimately se·
enred iu his property, as given in substantiaiiy the sama manner by

all the modern writers who have carefully consulted Donatus, Ser·

vius, and the other grammarians, among t ernost elaborate of whom
are La Rue, Heyne, Jahn, aud Forbiger. But we think it would
not be difficult to show, from the position of Pollio, and the situation .
of Gaul in reference ιο Octavianus, that the application os Virgil ιο
Octavianus is placed too ¹early. Withont entering into the reasons
b which this conclusion rs arrived at, we shall briefly state the con·
ciirsionitself. Vir ',as well us the other Mantuam, cnjoycd his
lande iu peace whr e Gaul was under the rdministratiou of Pollio.
