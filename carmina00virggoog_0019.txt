tally ascribed to it, it is highly improbable that Viryil resided in
that city at a period when the south of Italy was in commotion
hon the civil wars raging between Octavianus, Antony, and
Sextus Pompeius. But there is no difficulty if we assume that
the poet alludes to his occupatione, as was natural, towards the
conclusion of his work.

While engaged in the composition of the Georgius, Virgil
appears to have meditated another and a greater work, a main
object of which should be to exalt Octavianus Caesar. it is less
easy to tell what truth there is in the narrative of Donatus, which
isconfirmed by Servius, that our author had commencsd in his
youth a poem founded on early Roman history, but that the hard·
ness of the names deterred him. There are, however, sufficient
indications in his earlier poems that some such design was enter·
tained by him. And in the peace that the world now enjoyed,
he at lust commenoed his great undertaking, which occupied him
till the close of his life. He manifested in the Aeneid the same
attention to the passing events connected with his exalted patron
as he had done in the Georgics.

Donatus mentions that while Augustus was engaged in his
Spanish expedition, no. 27, he wrote to Virgil expressior his
anfiety to possess some specimens of his labour. We have an
extract from the poet's letter in reply. After acknowledging the
receipt of several letters from Angustus, he says, ‘With regard to
my (poem on) Aeneas, if Ι had anything worthy of your carel
should send it with pleasure. But 1 have only entered on the
subject, which is of such a nature, that 1 seem to myself to have
undertaken it almost from some fatuity of mind3 especially ae

and these of much greater moment.’¹ There have been also
referred to the sarno period the well-known lines of Propertius,
