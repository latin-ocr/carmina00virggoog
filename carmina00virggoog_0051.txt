Errabunda bovis vestigia3 forsitan illum,

Aut herba captum viridi, aut armenta secutum,
Perducant aliquae stabula ad Gortynia vaccae.² 60
Tum canit Hesperidum miratam mala puellam3

Tum Phaethontiadas musco circumdat amarae

(torticia, atque solo proceras erigit aluos.

Tum canit, errantem Permessi ad flumina Gallum
Aonas in montis ut duxerit una sororum, 65
thue viro Phoebi choms assurrexerit omnis 3

Ut Linus haec illi divino carmine pastor,

Floribus atque apio crinis ornatus amaro,

Dixerit: ‘Hos tibi dant calamos—en accipe—Musae,
Ascraeo quos ante seni, quibus ille solebat 7⁰
Cantando rigidas deducere montibus ornos.

His tibi Grynei nemoris dicatur origo,

Ne quis sit lucus, quo se plus jactet Apollo,'

Quid loquar, ut Scyllam Nisi, quarn fama secuta est,
Candida succinctam latrantibus inguina monstris 7⁵
Dulichias vexasse rates, et gurgite in alto
