It is now time to examine very brielly for ourselves the

three worlrs contained iu this volume. The first is the
Bocorrcr, or, as it is popularly called, the Eologues os Virgil.
The early occupationi os the poet-partly devoted to rural pur·
suits, and partly to the cultivation os Greek literature—naturally
interested him' in the writi‘ngs os Theocritus, who wrote in Greek
versa os the employments os the shepherd. His first thought
seems to have been to content himself with an imitation of his
master, seelring no other glory than to transfer to his own native
stream 8ηά fields, and to his own verse, the sentiments os the
Syracusan bard. Hence we find passages srorn the Idyllia, or
pastoral poenis os Theocritus, almost literally translated by Virgil.
Few of the ten Eologues are strictly pastoral. The lile os tlre
husbandmen in the north os Italy did not present the poet with
opportunities os drawing stom the lise a representation ot' the
easy and sunny existence os his Sicilian prototype. Accordingly,
with the exceptiones snatches here and there os rural life, we
find little to imbue us with a ehepherd's feelings or habits os
thinking, even in their poetised state. And the avowed transfer·
ence of syracusan song to northern Italy leads to a mingling up
ol' scenes, and personages, and deities which is unsavourable to
our sense of the real, and brings the artist too prominently be·
sore us.¹ N evertheless‚ they are deligbtsul poema. The images
are simple 8ηά suitable‚ and so is the leuguage in which they
are conveyed. Itis not much to say that they never oti'end3 but
this is at all events an advance upon Theocritus· The great error
οἰ Virgil was to imagine that they could ever be supposed to be a
shepherd's representation os soenes in a shepherd¹s lise. They are
in realitythe pictores osa polished mind, playiog, il' we may use
the expression, at shepberd. And we demet, we thinlr, iu the later
Eologues, greater, if uot complete, independence ot' his master,
leading to the invention of that pleasing, is not wholly natural
school os poetry, where the imagination inverte the rural life wrtlr
the cherma os its own retirement Here, too, Virgil presente us
with many specimens os that power of description which we shall
best place before the reader in the words oi a muster,² even
though it anticipato something ol what remeius to be said os tlre
Aeneid. ‘Iri the Epic, character sorbids the appearance ol descrip-
tions of natural soenes and objects otherwise than as subordinate
and occidental features, limited to a very small space: individual
localities are not portrayed, but an intimate understanding end
ove of nature manifest themselves occasionally with peculiar
beauty Where have the eost play os the waves, and the repose
