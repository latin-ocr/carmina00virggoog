ln the year a. ο. at, Augustus returned to Rome, and iu the
next yearvhe had the missortnne to lose by death Marcellus, the
son of his sister Octavia by her first husband. This young man,
who died in his twentieth year, hed been adopted by Augustus,
who gave him his daughter J ulia in marriage, and bestowed on
him so many marks of favour, that he was universally regarded
as his intended successor. Virgil, as usual, laid hold of this event
in his patron’s history, and thus enables us to iix the date of tha
sixth boolr as posterior ιο a. ο. 23. Tha following incidentis nar·
rated by Donatus, and alluded to by Servius, in connection with
the death of Marcellus. The poet, when liis work was far ad·
vanced, read to the emperor the second, fourth, and sixth boolrs-
it is to be presumed not all at one sitting. While hc was reading
the last boolr, Octavia was present. When he carne to the passage,
tl· Marcellus eris, Octavia fainted away, and the poet received
from her on her reoovery the munificent gili of ten restmt'o for
each of the lines referring to Marcellus.¹ We are told hythe
same authority that Virgil read with great sweetness, aud imparted
even to dull matter a charin which gave it a lise not its own.

With this date assigned to the sixth boolr agrees a passage in
the seventh. It hasbeen mentioned that the Parthians, Phraates,
then reigning as lting, and Tiridates, whom a conspiracy, exas
perated hy the cruelty of tlte soveroign, had raised up as a oom-
petitor for the throne, had applied for aid to Octavianus while in
Syria after tha conquestos Egypt The son of Phraates was at
that time in the hands of Tiridates, who placed hirn in the hands
of the Romans. Hc was talren to Rome, and application was
made for him, a. o. 23, by amhassadors from Phraates, while Tiri·
dates pleaded liis own causa in person. Augustus sent back the
youtlr, buton condition that the Roman prisoners and standards
talren in the disastrous defeat of Crassusq thirty years before,
should be restored. This was done n. ο. 20, and ufforded intense
gratificaticn to thenRomans. But there was in the meantime an
evident alternative of war, and to this Virgil alludes in the
seventh book. If this suggestion of La Rue, sanctioned hy
Hcyne, he correct, the six last boclts of the Aeneid were com· -
posed within a period of three years. During this time Augustus
was engaged in soma cf those extensive excursione which led
Suetonius to remark that Africa and Sardinia were the only
provinces of the Roman empire not visited by him, and which
seems ιο have excited the admiration of our author.
