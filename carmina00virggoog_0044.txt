ECLOGA V.

rua original Daphnis was a SIcilian hero, aud hIs name occurs
frequently in the ancient Pastorals. It is supposed that title
Eclogue was written a. o. 42, in which year public rejoicIngs
throughout Italy were ordered to celebrate the deilicatIcn ot'
Julius Caesar, the month of July being also named aller him.
According to this conjecture, which is not improbable, Virgil
celebrates Caesar under the name os DaphniS, though not car·
rying the resemblance through all its features. The poem hae
been extensively imitated, and has surnished materIals scr
many elegiae Eclogues. The first fifty-two liues'consist chiefly
of tomentatios, the remaining verses celebrate the deification
oi Daphnis.
