nuch 01 his early years 101110 studies that appertain to natural
philosophy.

With regard to his personal appearance, virgilie said to have
been tall, and stoutly made, 01 0 swartby colour, and with the
appearance 01 0101111101. Ηο was slow in speech, and no'one
could have judged from his conversation that he was 1110111001
learned 01 Romam poete. From 1110001111110110 tendency, aud 1110
wealr eyes 01 Horace, arose 1110 saying attributed to Augustus,
tlrat with these poete 011 either hand, he was sitting between
siglis and tears.

Virgil lived on terme 01 intimacy not only with men politioally
great, but with those 01 his contemporaries who were distin·
guished sor 111011 literary attainments, in that bright age 01
Aug'uetan literature. His biographer remarks that he was utterly
1100 1το111 011 literary jealousy, to such a degree, that the success-
1111 productione 01 others afforded him as much pleasure 0011
they were his own. His library was open to all men 01 learning
and he 011011 quoted the saying 01 Euripides, that ‘the property
01 friends was a common good! Hence towards him 1110 voice
01 envy was almost silent ; and Varius, Tucca, Horace, Propertius,
and others who adorned the time were devotedly attached 10
him. Though, like all other distinguished men, he did not want
detractore, his transcendant 11101110 were early achnowledged hy
1110110111οη0. 000110000001011,1100001111ιὸ1 to be in 1110 theatra
010 time when some lines 01 his own were being recited, 1110
people in a body rose and saluted him with the same honours aa ·
they were in the habit 01 rendering to Augustus. His modesty,
moreover, was equal tobis greatness. He seldom visited Rome.
The clear atmosphere and sparkling beauties 01 Naples attracted
him, 110111 consideratione both 01 11001111 and 01 teste. When
110 11111 appear in the streete, crowds followed him with the
tribute 01 admiration, but this gave him so little pleaeure, that
he was 10111 10 find, in the 01101101 01 1110 nearest house, a
refuge from 1110 throng. We cau traoe downwards 1110 pro·
01000 01 his same. Ovid, wlio was a young rnan 01 twenty·
sour when Virgil died, repeatedly takes notice 01 his writings.
Quintilian assigna to him 1110 001110 place in tlre study 01 Latin
which lre' does 10 Homer in that 01 Greek-the very highest and
most ‹lesirable 00 011 introduction. That he had been introduced
into 1110 00110010 01 Rome as early as the ageos Augustus, we
learn 110111 Suetonius. And the practice continued till a late
period, as we findit hoth recommended and mentioned by Augus·
tin and Orosius, who wrote about s. 11. stu. Caligula, however,
treated aliks contemptuously the claime 01 Virgil and Livy to
rlistiuotion5 and Adrion preferred Ennius to our poet. Tus
popularity 01 Virgil secured him early a 1100101 commentatore
