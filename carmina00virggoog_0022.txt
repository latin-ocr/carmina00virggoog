his father having become blind. He had lost, besides, by death,
two brothers3 but a stepbrother by the mother, Valerius Pro·
aulus, survived him. To him he leli ons-hall ol his property, and
the remainder, in various proportione, to Angustus, Maecenas,
L. Varius, aud Plotius Tucca. We cannot doubt that he hud
been enriched by the liberalityol' his patrous. According to
Aulus Gellius, a restrsal which he met with stom the people os
Nola, a town ol Campania, north os Vesuvius, when he wanted a
supply os water from their district lor an estate ol his, led him to
alter Nolo to Oro in the second Georgic, verse 225. This indi-
cates an early possession os property3 and we find more than one
instance os the impression made on his successore as to iris wealth
aud its source, as well as the importance os having Maecenases,
in order that there may be Virgils. Heyne hints at a conjecture
derived srom a passage in Propertius, that he may have had u
property near Tarentum and Donatus mentions not only the
estate in Campania, but another in Sicily. For these, however,
wehave but slight, or rather no warrant. Donatus rates his sor-
tune at about ten thousand sestertia) und states that his house st
Rome stood on the Esquiline Hill, near the gardens ol Maecenas

Tiberius retired thither to enjoy health aud retirement.

We are told that on his deathbed Virgil demanded to see his
papere, intending to burn the Aeneid, then in an unflnished state.
His friends remonstrated with him, and in his will he lest in-
structions regarding it, ol‘ which we have various accounts. He
either ordered it to be burned, or he leli it to the discretiori ol'
L. Varius and Plotius Tucca-both mentioned by Horace aa
friends of Virgil, and eminently fitted for such a charge-direct·
ing thern, whatever they suppresscd, to add nothing-not even
to complete unfinished lines. Augustus interiered to save the
poem stom destruction, and by his directions Varius and Tucca
performed the taslr assigned them, bequeathing it to posterity ss

It is also said, und stom Virgil's own language, as well as
his temperament, it is probable enough, thet it was his inten-
tion, aller he hud givrm the last finish to the worlr, to devote
himself to philosophical pursuits. Witheut giving credence to
the absurd fictione contained in his lile by Donmus, we have
no reason to doubt the statement that the poet had devoted
