ancs as the avenger οἰ his adopted father. And thus we fiad
Octavianus sor stirne on tha side ot* the constitutional party,
lauded by Cicero, and trusted, in appearance at least, by the
senate. ln a. c. 43 he was sent by the senate, along with Hir-
tius and Pansa the consuls, to relieve D. Brutus, whom Autony
was besiegiug in Mutina. ln this they succeeded, aud Antony
fied into Gaul; but both the consuls were killed. The senate,
however, from some mistrust os Octavianus, instead of conferring
the command upon him, directed D. Brutus to head the armies
against Antony, who was again beccining sormidable through tha
aid ol Lepidus, then cornmanding in Transalpina Gaul. Octa·
vianus, on his return to Rome, was at flrst coldly received by tha
senate3 but the soldiers revered the memory ol Caesar, and their
influence procured sor him the consulship, and the outlawry of
the conspirators, cs course including D. Brutus, who was betrayed
by his officere and elain-Antony and his sollowers being freed
from a sentence of outlawry passed against him. It was in this
year, a. c. 4³, thartha Second Triumvirate, which was tn continue
lor five years, was lormed by Antony, Lepidus, and Octavianus,
who sliarcd among themselves the government of the world.
But it was necessary to put down their enemies at home, and meet
the troops under Brutus and Cassius, who were theu engaged in
Macedonia and in the East. The former was done by a searsul
proscription‚ most mercilessly carried into effect against the per·
soual euemics of each member os the Triumvirate. To accom-
plieh the latter, Antony and Octavianus crossed over into Graece,
and thence procceded to Macedonia, where, in the two battles of
Philippi, Cassius and Brutus were defeated, and slew themselves,
a. o. 42. Antony, unhappily sor himself, procceded to Asia, while
Octavianus returned to Italy. One os the objecta oi the latter in
doing this was to secure the support oi the soldiers, by bestowing
ou them land, on which they might settle, and which had been
promised them at the very commencement οἰ the troubles conse·
quent on the death ol Caesar, as the reward of their services.
This is sometimes done in the case of veteran soldiers by our own
goverument, but always in anew country, where no hardsbip is
inilicted ou any one; arrd it is supposed that thus tharsis secured
both a raca of sturdy cultivators and os brave adherents to the
parent country. ln the case os the Roman soldiers, it was inevi-
tabls that the grossest injustice should be perpetrated, and the
greatest misery occasioned, sor the scheme was to deprive os their
