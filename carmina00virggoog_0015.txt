cient, and hence an indiscriminate spoliation took place, reaching
to all ranks and all parties. It became evident that the struggle
was now between a licentious army and the whole inhabitants
ol' Italy. ln the meantime L. Antonius, brother of the triumvir,
and then consul, along with Fulvia, the triumvir’s wife, to secure
to Antony some of the popularity with the soldiers likely to accrue
from the division of the lands, persuaded Octavianus to leave to
- ure officere of Antony the duty of assigning to his troops the landa
which fell to their share. Those despoiled by the latter fled in
turn to Octavianus, who at first was not unwilling to court the
popular favour by protecting them. But he found that, after all,
the army was his great support; and he finally entered into their
oause without restraint, while L. Antonius, in turn, threw himself
on the people.

Thus there were two parties arrayed against each other in open
war, the subject being the division of the lands-L. Antonius at
the head of the people, and Octavianus at that of the army. The
siege of Perusia, in Etruria, at the Trasimene Lalre, where L.
Antonius was shut up by Octavianus, ended unfortunately for the
latter, a. o. 40, and the army finally triumphed.

We must now loolr at the bearing which these events have on
the history of Virgil. When the division of the Roman world
among the triumvirs took place, the Gauls constituted one of the
provinces assigned to Antony. The charge of Gallia Transpadana,
that portion of Cisalpine Gaul which lay between the Po and
the Alps, and in which Cremona and Mantua were situated‚
was given to Asinius Pollio, who was six years older than Virgil‚
and had been a faithful adherent of Julius Caesar. He was not
only a brave soldier, but a celebrated orator; and in addition to
his historical labours, had devoted himself to poetry. A friend
and patron of poets, and a literary man, it is fair to infor that he
fostered the growing genius ο1 tlte young Virgil‚ who came under
his special notice, as living in his province, engaged in agricul-
ture and the service ο1 the Muses. It was his office to divide
among the soldiers the portion of the lands which lay in the
country over which he presided. Ι1 the ordinary account be
correct, Pollio must have found himself unable, by his own au·
thority, to reserva the lands of the poet, highly though he esteenred
him. Virgil had already written some of the Eclogues,¹ by which
he gave early promise of his future fame; and in a friendly spirit
Pollio counselled him to seelr the protection of Octavianus. We
have no information how the poet obtained access to Octavianus3
but his prayer was granted, and lris lands in the meantime sa·
sured to him-a service which he celebrates in the first Eclogue.
