lt may be seen from this that Virgil does not, as a historiari
would, introduce the subject with the sall os Troy, and con·
duct Aeneas, iu the ordesos time, through his adventures till
their conclusion. Following the example oi Homer, in both
his great Epics, the Iliad and tha Odyssey, he dashes at once
into the middle ot' the subject-a plan praised by Horace (Dr
Arte Poet. 148), and ohserved hythe writers ot* Epic poems in
modern times, 00 in Milton's Paradise Lost‚ which does nor
begin with the creation os the world, bnt talres up the subject
alter the world has been created, and many events bearing on
the main action have already occurred.
