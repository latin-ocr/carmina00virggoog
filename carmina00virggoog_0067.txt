Groaercos, the genitive plural in the Greek form, is derived
srom γεωργικὸς, belonging to husbandmen. This work treats
of the various departments of farming, and is divided into four
books. The subject 01⁴ the first book, generally, is the cultiva-
tion of the soil, sor the growth os crops. More particularly, we
have an introduction‚ addressed to Virgil's patron, Maecenas,
stating the nature of the whole work, 1-5; then an. invocation
to Sol, Luna, Liber, Ceres, the Fauns, the Dryades, Neptune,
Aristaeus, Pan, Minerva, Triptolemus, Silvanus, and all the
rural deities, along with Augustus Caesar, 5-42. Virgil then
discusses the proper time and mode of ploughing and manuring,
with reference to sessori, soil, sallow, succession of crops, irri-
gation, seeding down, end draining, 43-117. In connection
with the trouble necessary to protect the soil from mischievous
animale and plante, labour and invention are shown to be the
result os Jupiter's succession to the throne of heaven, 118-159.
The instruments os agriculture are described, 160-175. Mis·
