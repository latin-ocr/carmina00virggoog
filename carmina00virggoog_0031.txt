ECLOGA 1.

Tar title Bucolica was probably that given to these poema by
Virgil himself. lt is borrowed from the Greek word, Βουκολι-
κὸς, and signifies, pertuining to the shepherd lise-pastoral. The
title Ecloga was probably added by the critias. It also is hor·
rowed from the Greek, ἐκλογὴ, o selected piece ,- so that Bucolicon
Eclogae means, selectione from pastoral poema, Bucolieon being
the genitive plural in the Greek form. ln consequence os this
title, Ecbgo, having been so applied, Eclague eomes to mean
a pastoral poem. ·

The subject of the first Eclogue is the gratitude ot* Virgil to Au·
gustus, sor having restored to him his lands, iu the neighbour-
hood os Mantua, as has been narrated in his Lise. The poet
brings this out by a dialoguebetween two shepherds, one os
whom, Meliboeus, is forced to leave his country by the soldiers.
The other shepherd, Tityrus, representing one os the ‹lispos-
sessed inhabitants, is seated in the enjoyment of sreedom and
peace, both of which he had gained in a visit to Rome. This
is intended to indicate, in a general way, Virgil's own condi
tion3 but the resemblance must not be pressed too closely.
The Eelogue is supposed to have been written in the autumn
of ao. 41, when Virgil was twenty-nine years old⁴
