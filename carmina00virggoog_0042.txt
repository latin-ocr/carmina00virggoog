tho blockade formed by the fleets of Autony aud Sex.'Pompeius.
So much the greater was the joy occasioned hythe treaty os
Brundusium made iu the autumn os ac. 40, by which har-
monywas restored betweenthe two contendingchiets. Antony'a
agent in arranging the peace was Virgil’s patron, Asinius Pollio.
A little ulterwards, on his return to Rome, Pollio entered on
the consulship, and about the same time had a son born to him.
There was a common belief at tha time that a new age was
dawniug ou the world; and as Italy seomed to have escaped
from its miserias chiefly through the means os Pollio, Virgil, in
this Eclogue, cougratulates him ou his consulship, and does it
in such a way, as at once to extol him as the harbinger of a
new era os happiness, aud at the same time to augur this,
from the birth os his sou, as an omen os futura peace aud
prosperity. This Eclogue was written iu the autumn of nelo.

Srcamnrrs Musae, paulo majora canamus!
Nou omnis arbusta juvant humilesque myricae,
si canimus silvas, silvae siut Consule dignae.
· Ultima Cumaei venit 'am carminis aetas 3
Magnus ab integro saec orum nascitur ordo. o
Jam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna3
Jam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.
Tu modo trascenti puero, quo ferrea primum
Desinet, ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,
Casta save Lucina: tuus jam regnat Apollo. 1⁰
Teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te Consule, inibit,
Pollio, et incipient magui procedere meuses,
Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,
Irrita perpetua solvent formidine tetras.
Ille deum vitam accipiet, divisque videbit 1⁵
Permixtas heroas, el ipse videbitur illis,
Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.
